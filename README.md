# Second Time

…again?

I made another program to protect my file with a password.  
And yes, I forgot it **again** 😭

This is the second time this has happened, so I really should’ve learned my lesson.

They say *third time’s the charm*…  
but before that, can you recover the password this time?

Luckily, the program still remembers the correct one.
